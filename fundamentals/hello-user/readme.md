# Hello User Script

The index HTML file contains a simple JavaScript script that prompts the user for their name and then displays an alert greeting them with "Hello, [name]!".

## How It Works

1. When the page is loaded, a prompt dialog appears asking the user, "What is your name?".
2. The user inputs their name into the prompt.
3. An alert dialog then displays a greeting message, "Hello, [name]!", where `[name]` is the input provided by the user.

## Usage

To use this script, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The script will automatically execute upon loading the page.
